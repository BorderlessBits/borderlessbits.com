## Public Repository Security Guidelines

This is a **PUBLIC repository** for a business website. Follow these security practices:

### ‚úÖ What CAN be public:
- Website source code (Next.js, TypeScript, React)
- Styling and design system (Tailwind CSS)

### ‚ùå What must NEVER be committed:
- API keys or secrets
- Email service credentials  
- Analytics private keys
- Client data or private case studies
- Database credentials

- Any `.env` files with real values

### üîí Security Measures in Place:

1. **Secrets Management**
   - All sensitive values stored in GitHub Secrets

   - Regular security audits via `npm audit`
   - Automated security scanning in CI/CD

4. **Content Security**
   - Input sanitization on all forms
   - Content Security Policy headers

### üö® If You Find a Security Issue:

**Do NOT:**
